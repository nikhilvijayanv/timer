# Task 29: Final Integration Testing and Bug Fixes

**Phase:** 6 - Timer Logic & Integration
**Dependencies:** All previous tasks in Phase 6

## Description

Conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing of the entire application, fix any bugs found, and ensure all features work together smoothly.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create comprehensive test plan**
   Create `scripts/integration-test-plan.md`:

   ```markdown
   # Timer App Integration Test Plan

   ## Environment Setup

   - [ ] Clean database (delete timer.db)
   - [ ] Reset config.json to defaults
   - [ ] Fresh app start

   ## Core Timer Flow

   ### Start Timer

   - [ ] Enter task name "Integration Test 1"
   - [ ] Click Start
   - [ ] Verify CompactTimerView appears
   - [ ] Verify time starts at 0:00 and increments
   - [ ] Verify tray shows "‚è± 0:01"
   - [ ] Verify start sound plays
   - [ ] Verify QuickTaskEntry disappears

   ### Timer Running

   - [ ] Let timer run for 30 seconds
   - [ ] Verify time display updates every second
   - [ ] Verify tray updates every second
   - [ ] Click outside window to hide
   - [ ] Verify timer continues in background
   - [ ] Click tray to reopen
   - [ ] Verify timer still running with correct time

   ### Stop Timer

   - [ ] Click stop button
   - [ ] Verify CompactTimerView disappears
   - [ ] Verify QuickTaskEntry reappears
   - [ ] Verify stop sound plays
   - [ ] Verify tray shows "Timer"
   - [ ] Verify entry appears in TodayEntries
   - [ ] Verify duration is approximately 30 seconds

   ## Tasks Management

   - [ ] Create task "Task A"
   - [ ] Create task "Task B"
   - [ ] Create task "Task C"
   - [ ] Verify all tasks in Tasks view
   - [ ] Switch to Timer view
   - [ ] Open Recent tab
   - [ ] Verify tasks appear in dropdown
   - [ ] Select "Task B" from dropdown
   - [ ] Verify timer starts with correct task name

   ## Multiple Timers

   - [ ] Start timer "Session 1"
   - [ ] Wait 15 seconds, stop
   - [ ] Start timer "Session 2"
   - [ ] Wait 20 seconds, stop
   - [ ] Start timer "Session 3"
   - [ ] Wait 10 seconds, stop
   - [ ] Verify all 3 entries in TodayEntries
   - [ ] Verify total duration calculated correctly

   ## Time Entry Management

   - [ ] Click edit icon on first entry
   - [ ] Add note "Test note"
   - [ ] Save note
   - [ ] Verify note appears in entry
   - [ ] Delete an entry
   - [ ] Verify entry removed
   - [ ] Verify total duration recalculated

   ## Global Shortcut

   - [ ] Focus another app
   - [ ] Press global shortcut (Cmd+Alt+Shift+.)
   - [ ] Verify timer starts
   - [ ] Verify task name is "Quick Timer"
   - [ ] Verify start sound plays
   - [ ] Press shortcut again
   - [ ] Verify timer stops
   - [ ] Verify stop sound plays

   ## Settings

   - [ ] Open Settings dialog
   - [ ] Change theme to Dark
   - [ ] Verify UI switches to dark mode
   - [ ] Toggle sound off
   - [ ] Save settings
   - [ ] Start/stop timer
   - [ ] Verify no sound plays
   - [ ] Reopen settings
   - [ ] Toggle sound back on
   - [ ] Change theme to Light
   - [ ] Save and verify changes persist

   ## Navigation

   - [ ] Click Timer tab
   - [ ] Click Tasks tab
   - [ ] Click Projects tab (verify placeholder)
   - [ ] Click Reports tab (verify placeholder)
   - [ ] Press Cmd+1 (Timer)
   - [ ] Press Cmd+2 (Tasks)
   - [ ] Press Cmd+3 (Projects)
   - [ ] Press Cmd+4 (Reports)

   ## Edge Cases

   - [ ] Try to start timer with empty name (should be disabled)
   - [ ] Start timer, immediately stop (< 1 second)
   - [ ] Start timer, wait 1 hour, stop
   - [ ] Create task with very long name (50+ chars)
   - [ ] Create 20+ tasks
   - [ ] Create 50+ time entries
   - [ ] Restart app, verify data persists

   ## Performance

   - [ ] Monitor CPU usage with timer running (should be < 2%)
   - [ ] Monitor memory usage over 10 minutes (no leaks)
   - [ ] UI remains responsive with many entries
   - [ ] Database operations fast (< 50ms)

   ## App Lifecycle

   - [ ] Start app
   - [ ] Verify app not in dock
   - [ ] Verify tray icon appears
   - [ ] Start timer
   - [ ] Quit app via tray menu
   - [ ] Restart app
   - [ ] Verify timer data persisted
   - [ ] Verify config persisted

   ## Error Handling

   - [ ] Corrupt database file (should recover)
   - [ ] Invalid config.json (should use defaults)
   - [ ] Missing audio files (should fail gracefully)
   ```

2. **Execute test plan**
   Go through each item methodically, recording results

3. **Create bug tracking document**
   Create `scripts/bugs-found.md`:

   ```markdown
   # Bugs Found During Integration Testing

   ## Bug Template

   **ID:** BUG-XXX
   **Severity:** High / Medium / Low
   **Component:** Timer / Tasks / UI / etc.
   **Description:** What's wrong
   **Steps to Reproduce:**

   1. ...
   2. ...
      **Expected:** What should happen
      **Actual:** What actually happens
      **Fix:** How to fix (if known)
      **Status:** Open / In Progress / Fixed

   ---

   (Add bugs found during testing here)
   ```

4. **Common bugs to check for**
   - Timer doesn't update when window hidden
   - Sounds don't play consistently
   - Tray doesn't update
   - Database locked errors
   - Memory leaks from event listeners
   - Race conditions on rapid clicks
   - UI state not syncing
   - Time calculations off by seconds

5. **Fix identified bugs**
   For each bug:
   - Create a focused fix
   - Test the fix thoroughly
   - Verify no regressions
   - Document the fix

6. **Add defensive code**
   Add guards for common issues:

   ```typescript
   // Example: Guard against rapid clicking
   const [isProcessing, setIsProcessing] = useState(false);

   const handleStart = async () => {
     if (isProcessing) return; // Prevent double-click

     setIsProcessing(true);
     try {
       // ... operation
     } finally {
       setIsProcessing(false);
     }
   };
   ```

7. **Add data validation**

   ```typescript
   // Validate before database operations
   if (!taskName || taskName.trim().length === 0) {
     throw new Error('Task name required');
   }

   if (taskName.length > 255) {
     throw new Error('Task name too long');
   }
   ```

8. **Performance optimization**
   - Debounce rapid updates
   - Memoize expensive calculations
   - Lazy load components if needed
   - Optimize database queries

9. **Create final checklist**

   ```markdown
