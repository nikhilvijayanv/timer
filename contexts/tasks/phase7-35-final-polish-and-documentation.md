   npm run lint

   # Run tests
   npm test

   # Run E2E tests (requires build)
   npm run build:dir
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

   ## Project Structure

   ```
   timer/
   ├── electron/          # Main process
   │   ├── main.ts
   │   ├── preload.ts
   │   ├── services/

   ├── build/             # Build assets
   └── release/           # Build output
   ```

   ## Tasks

   See `contexts/tasks/` for detailed task breakdown (35 tasks across 7 phases).

   ## Coding Standards

   - **Style:** Prettier (run `npm run format`)
   - **Linting:** ESLint (run `npm run lint`)
   - **TypeScript:** Strict mode
   - **Commits:** Conventional commits

   ## Testing

   - **Unit:** Vitest for services
   - **E2E:** Playwright for flows
   - **Manual:** See integration test plan

   ## Contributing

   1. Fork the repository
   2. Create feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
   3. Commit changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
   4. Push to branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
   5. Open Pull Request

   ## Build

   See [Build Instructions](BUILD.md)
   ```

3. **Create known issues document**
   Create `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`:
   ```markdown
   # Known Issues

   ## Current Limitations

   ### Features Not Yet Implemented
   - **Projects:** Organizing timers by project (planned)
   - **Reports:** Analytics and time breakdown (planned)
   - **Export:** CSV/PDF export (planned)
   - **Cloud Sync:** No cloud backup (future)

   ### Platform Support
   - **macOS only:** Currently only supports macOS
   - **Windows/Linux:** Not supported (future consideration)

   ### Minor Issues

   #### Tray Icon
   - Default icon may not match all themes perfectly
   - Custom icon recommended (see `build/README.md`)

   #### Global Shortcut
   - Requires app to be running
   - May conflict with other apps
   - Restart required to change

   #### Database
   - No automatic backup
   - Manual backup: Copy `~/Library/Application Support/Timer/timer.db`

   ## Workarounds

   ### App Won't Open (Gatekeeper)
   **Issue:** "Timer cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"

   **Solution:**
   1. Right-click app → Open
   2. Click "Open" in dialog
   3. Or: System Preferences → Security → Allow

   ### Timer Doesn't Start
   **Check:**
   1. Another timer already running?
   2. Database permissions
   3. Console.app for errors

   ### Sounds Don't Play
   **Check:**
   1. Settings → Sound enabled?
   2. System sound settings
   3. Audio files exist in app bundle

   ### High CPU Usage
   **Possible causes:**
   1. Many time entries (> 1000)
   2. UI re-rendering issues
   3. Background processes

   **Solution:** Restart app, clear old data

   ## Reporting Issues

   Please report bugs with:
   - macOS version
   - App version
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Console logs (if applicable)

   [Report Issue](https://github.com/yourusername/timer/issues/new)
