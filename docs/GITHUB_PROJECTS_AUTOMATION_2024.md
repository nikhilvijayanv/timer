2. **Look at the TOP RIGHT** of the page (not the column)

### Location 2: Project Settings

## ðŸ”„ Built-in Workflows Available

When you open Workflows, you'll see these options:

### 1. Auto-add to project

**What it does:** Automatically adds items when they match criteria

**Configure:**

- Click "Edit"
- Set filters (label, assignee, etc.)
- Choose target column (Todo, In Progress, Done)

**Example:**

```
When: Issue has label "in-progress"
Then: Set status to "In Progress"
```

### 2. Auto-archive

**What it does:** Moves items when they're closed/merged

**Configure:**

- Click "Edit"
- Choose when to trigger (issue closed, PR merged)
- Set target status (Done)

**Example:**

```
When: Issue is closed
Then: Set status to "Done"
```

### 3. Auto-update

**What it does:** Updates status based on events

**Configure:**

- Click "Edit"
- Choose trigger event
- Set new status

## ðŸš« If Workflows Menu Doesn't Exist

### Alternative: Use GitHub Actions Instead

Your GitHub Actions workflows (already set up) can update the project:

**File:** `.github/workflows/update-project.yml`

```yaml
name: Update Project Board

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, closed, reopened, assigned]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, closed, ready_for_review, converted_to_draft]

jobs:
  update-project:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Move to In Progress when PR opened
        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.action == 'opened'
        uses: actions/add-to-project@v0.5.0
        with:
          project-url: https://github.com/users/nikhilvijayanv/projects/1
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          labeled: in-progress
          column-name: In Progress

      - name: Move to Done when closed
        if: github.event.action == 'closed'
        uses: actions/add-to-project@v0.5.0
        with:
          project-url: https://github.com/users/nikhilvijayanv/projects/1
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          column-name: Done
```

## ðŸ’¡ Manual Alternative

If automation is too complex, you can:

### Drag and Drop Manually

- **Starting work?** â†’ Drag issue to "In Progress"
- **Finished?** â†’ Drag issue to "Done"

Takes 2 seconds per task, totally fine for 35 tasks!

### Use Labels Instead

The GitHub Actions workflows already set labels:

- Issue gets `in-progress` label â†’ You see it's being worked on
- Issue gets `completed` label â†’ You see it's done
- PROGRESS.md auto-updates â†’ You track completion

**You don't really need the board to move automatically!**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Manual Board Management (Simplest)

- Let GitHub Actions handle labels
- Manually drag issues on board
- PROGRESS.md tracks everything

### Option 2: Workflows (If Available)

- Find "â‹®" menu in top right
- Click "Workflows"
- Enable automation

### Option 3: Skip Board Automation

- Just use the Issues list
- Labels show status
- PROGRESS.md tracks completion
- Run `./scripts/status.sh` to see progress

**Honestly, you don't need the board to be automatic!** The other automations (labels, PROGRESS.md) are more important and already work.

---

## âœ… What's Already Automatic (Without Board)

- âœ… Issues close when PR merged
- âœ… Labels update (`in-progress`, `completed`)
- âœ… PROGRESS.md updates
- âœ… Comments added to issues
- âœ… Branch deleted after merge

**That's the important stuff!** The board is just a visual nice-to-have.

---

## ðŸš€ Your Workflow Works Even Without Board Automation

```bash
# Start task
./scripts/quick-start.sh
# â†’ Creates branch
# â†’ Shows task details

# Work and commit
git commit -m "Changes (progress on #1)"

# Create PR
gh pr create --fill
# â†’ Links to issue
# â†’ Issue labeled "in-progress" âœ…

# Merge PR
gh pr merge
# â†’ Issue closes âœ…
# â†’ PROGRESS.md updates âœ…
# â†’ Issue labeled "completed" âœ…

# Check progress
./scripts/status.sh
# â†’ Shows completion %
```

**Everything important is already automatic!**

Board movement is just visual - you can manually drag tasks or ignore the board entirely.

---

**Bottom line:** Don't worry about the board automation. The important stuff (labels, PROGRESS.md, issue closing) already works!
